Creating ROIs with FSL; based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9hE0vAztnQ

1.	There is a need to enter to fsleyes the MNI cordinates. (file>add standart>MNI_152_T1_2mm)
Enter the MNI cordinates and based on  this take the voxel location: This will be used on the Ubunto: 
Don’t forget to change the name of the file- e.g, here a ROI for the IPS was created 

2.	
fslmaths $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm.nii.gz -mul 0 -add 1 -roi 32 1 34 1 60 1 0 1 IPSpoint -odt float
this will create a file that is based on the Roi we defined. 

3.	
fslmaths IPSpoint.nii.gz -kernel sphere 5 -fmean IPSsphere -odt float
This will create a spheres around the ROI- 5 cm in this case .

4.	
fslmaths IPSsphere.nii.gz -bin IPS_bin.nii.gz
This will take the previous file that was created and will transfer it to a binaric file. This is the file we will probably gonna use. 

Now the file is in the directory of Linox and we need to transfer it to be used in Windows: 
5.	If we do it via a usb stick: Look how the usb stick is named on your computer. I would like to connect it now to Lynox: D in that case is the directory I used. 

sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/usb

6.	Copy the new file we want to the usb: 
cp IPS_bin.nii.gz /mnt/usb/    



How to make ICC: 


Two scripts are saved on github- those are the scripts for the calculation. 
In order to do it, I need: 
1.	Mask- the mask is created in CONN, resaults of second analysis. It’s a binaric file, when openning it for view (spm) I should see only intenstity of 0/1. 
However, the mask that is created is not on the same voxel measures as the rest of the niftis, so there is a need to change it. 
2.	This can be done via SPM, Via the function of ImCalC. There is a need to take two files: 
First: a nifti file with the right measures. Every nifti file will be sufficient. 
Second: the file I want to change. 
Expression: write: i2 

This will create a binaric mask with the right dimentions.
